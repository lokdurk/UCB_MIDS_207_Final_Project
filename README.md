# UCB_MIDS_207_Final_Project
This is the final project submission for Claudia Durkin, Tess Cotter, and Jessica Matthews entitled 
"Using Machine Learning to Predict Executive Gender Pay Gaps"
The data are linked to a google drive. We have commented out a pairwise correleation block, as it takes a long time to run and didn't add much to our analysis. 
We have included our notebook and pdf of our slides.
